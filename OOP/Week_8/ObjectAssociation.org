* Object Association
Following are the types of object associations:
1. Simple
   - One Way 
   - Two Way -
   - N array ◇
2. Aggregation ◇
   - Weaker Relationship
   - A relation where objects can exist independently.
   - Unfilled dimond for symbol
3. Composition ◆
   - Stronger relation
   - A relation where objects can't exist independently.
   - Filled dimond
* Inheritance
*Consider the follwing objects with attributes:*
1. *Student*
#+begin_src cpp

int id;
string name;
int age;
string progam;

study();
eat();
walk();

#+end_src
2. *Doctor*
#+begin_src cpp

int id;
string name;
int age;
string progam;

cure();
eat();
walk();

#+end_src
3. *Teacher*
#+begin_src cpp

int id;
string name;
int age;
string progam;

teach();
eat();
walk();

#+end_src
In the above example we have some common attributes which we can combine into a single *Person* class. From which all the other classes can inherit the attributes.
1. *Person:*
#+begin_src cpp

int id;
string name;
int age;
string progam;

eat();
walk();

#+end_src
    1. Student
       #+begin_src cpp
study();
       #+end_src
    2. Doctor
       #+begin_src cpp
cure();
       #+end_src
    3. Teacher
       #+begin_src cpp
teach();
       #+end_src
