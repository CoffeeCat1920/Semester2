* Directory
Another name for *Folder*.

This folder is in "Semester2/Software_Configuration_Management/Week_1".
* Workspace
A place to collaborate.
** Example
- Suppose there are three teams *T1, T2, T3*. They can use each other as *backups*.
- This git repo.
* Source/Code files
*Directories* that have *all the code*.
* Phases of SCM:
** Identify
Identifying things to update.
** Baseline
The most updated stable (working) version of the code.
*** Example
if we have v1, v2, *v3*, **v4**.
if **v4** is latest but unstable then stabe *v3* version is baseline.
** Change management
To keep track of:
- The change
- Who made the change
- When they made the change.
** Configuration audit
To make sure that the configuration is up to standards and is being used correctely.
* Managing different version
- Suppose we are working on two files *f1* and *f2*, after some times we add another *f3* into the project.
- After making the change it becomes a new *branch* is made in the *git*.
- The third step is to add the new brach to our original branch through a process called *merging*.
