* Difference between Centrilize and Decentralized Version Control
| Decentrilized                               | Centrilized                                 |
|---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| 1. Each Person has same copy of the project | 1. Each person has same view of the project |
| 2. Commit is needed for sync.               | 2. Commit is not needed for sync.           |
| 3. Anyone can clone each other repos.       | 3. It's not possible.                       |
| 4. Complex structure.                       | 4. Relatively less complex.                 |
** Drawbacks of Decentralized version control
1. Complex Structure
2. Potential for code divergence
** Drawbacks of Centrilized version control
1. Server can become bottlenecked specially in case of large teams.
2. Constant depenedency on the network.
