# Discrete Structures

- Introduction
    
    ### Discrete and Continuous Values:
    
    ### Discrete Values:
    
    Discrete values are distinct and separate, often countable. Examples include:
    
    - Number of students in a class
    - Number of cars in a parking lot
    - Number of goals scored in a football match
    
    ### Continuous Values:
    
    Continuous values can take any value within a range. Examples include:
    
    - Height of a person
    - Weight of an object
    - Temperature in Celsius
    
    ### Discrete Structures:
    
    In discrete structures, we study fundamental concepts like:
    
    - Sets
    - Functions
    - Logics
    - Theories
    - Combinatorics
    
    ### Propositional Logic:
    
    Propositional logic deals with propositions, which are statements that are either true or false.
    
    ### Propositional Statements:
    
    Propositional statements are declarative sentences that are either true or false. For example:
    
    - "The sky is blue."
    - "2 + 2 = 4."
    - "It is raining."
    
    (Note: Questions are not propositional statements, as they can have multiple answers.)
    
    ### Compound Proposition:
    
    Compound propositions are formed by combining simpler propositions using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT.
    
    ### Examples of Compound Propositions:
    
    - "It is raining AND the sun is shining."
    - "It is not raining OR it is cloudy."
    - "If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella."
    
    ### Propositional Operators:
    
    - **(Conjunction)AND (`∧`)**: Represents conjunction, where both propositions must be true for the compound proposition to be true. Example: "It is raining ∧ the ground is wet."
    - **(Disjunction)OR (`∨`)**: Represents disjunction, where at least one of the propositions must be true for the compound proposition to be true. Example: "It is raining ∨ it is snowing."
        
        ### **Inclusive OR:**
        
        - Similar to disjunction but allows for the possibility of both operands being `true`.
        - Example: To take any math course, you need either Calculus or Quantitative Reasoning, or both.
        1. **Exclusive OR (XOR):**
            - Denoted by `^`.
            - Returns `true` if only one of the operands is `true`.
            - Example: Based on your performance, you will get either a promotion or $50, but not both.
        
        ### Truth Tables:
        
        ### Inclusive OR:
        
        | A | B | A OR B |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | false | false | false |
        | false | true | true |
        | true | false | true |
        | true | true | true |
        
        ### Exclusive OR:
        
        | A | B | A XOR B |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | false | false | false |
        | false | true | true |
        | true | false | true |
        | true | true | false |
    - **(Negation)NOT (`¬`)**: Represents negation, where the proposition is true if the original proposition is false, and vice versa. Example: "It is not raining."
    - **(Implication)Implies (`⇒`)**: Represents implication, where if the first proposition is true, then the second proposition must also be true. Example: "If it is raining, then the ground is wet."
    
    > A is true , B is true,B is true it doesnt mean A is true.
    > 
    - **If and only if (`⇔`)**: Represents biconditional, where both propositions have the same truth value. Example: "It is raining if and only if the ground is wet."
    
    > A is true , B is true.b is true if and only if A is true.
    > 
    - **Exclusive OR (`XOR`)**: Represents exclusive disjunction, where only one of the propositions can be true for the compound proposition to be true. Example: "It is raining XOR it is snowing."
    - **NAND (`⊼`)**: Represents negation of conjunction, where the compound proposition is false only if both propositions are true. Example: "It is not the case that it is raining AND the ground is wet."
- Implication & Stuff
    
    ### Implication:
    
    - Denoted by -`>`.
    - Represents "if A, then B".
    - Returns `false` only when A is `true` and B is `false`.
    
    Example:
    If it's raining (A), then I will take an umbrella (B).
    
    ### Truth Table for Implication:
    
    | A | B | A -> B |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | false | false | true |
    | false | true | true |
    | true | false | false |
    | true | true | true |
    
    ### Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive:
    
    1. **Converse:** Swapping the hypothesis and conclusion.
        - Example: If I take an umbrella, then it's raining.
    2. **Inverse:** Negating both the hypothesis and conclusion.
        - Example: If it's not raining, then I won't take an umbrella.
    3. **Contrapositive:** Negating and swapping both the hypothesis and conclusion.
        - Example: If I don't take an umbrella, then it's not raining.

    **Propositional Logic:**
    
    - Deals with propositions: declarative statements that are either true or false.
    - Focuses on the logical relationships between propositions.
    
    **Types of Propositions:**
    
    - **True:** 2 + 3 = 5, The Earth revolves around the Sun.
    - **False:** Every integer has a square root.
    - **Non-propositions:** Questions, commands, ambiguous statements, subjective opinions.
    
    **Basic Logical Operators:**
    
    1. **Negation (NOT):** ¬
        - Example: If p is "It is raining," then ¬p is "It is not raining."
    2. **Conjunction (AND):** ∧
        - Example: p ∧ q = "It is raining and I have an umbrella."
    3. **Disjunction (OR):** ∨
        - Example: p ∨ q = "It is raining or I have an umbrella."
    4. **Inclusive OR:** True if at least one statement is true.
        - Example: "To study Software Engineering, you need C++ or Python."
    5. **Exclusive OR:** True if exactly one statement is true.
        - Example: "Select p or q, but not both."
    
    **Compound Propositional Logic:**
    
    - Combining propositions with logical operators.
    - Examples:
        - Conditional statement: p → q ("If it rains, I carry an umbrella.")
        - Disjunction with negation: ¬p ∨ q ("File is not corrupted or I have backup.")
        - Conjunctive statement: p ∧ q ("Software updated and patches installed.")
        - Implication with contradiction: p → ¬q ("Correct password but access denied.")
    
    **Additional Notes:**
    
    - Order of operations matters! Use parentheses as needed.
    - Truth tables can be used to evaluate compound propositions.
    - This is just an introduction to propositional logic. More complex concepts are covered later.
    
    ### Implication
    
    **Definition:**
    
    - Implication (p→q) is a logical statement where p is the antecedent/hypothesis and q is the consequent/conclusion.
    - It asserts that if p is true, then q must also be true.
    
    **Approaches to Implication:**
    
    1. **Logic (True/False):**
        - Construct truth tables to evaluate the logical truth of the statement.
    2. **Meaning:**
        - Understand the true implications of the statement in real-world scenarios.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    1. **Example 1:**
        - Statement: If you try hard, then you will succeed.
        - p = you try hard, q = you will succeed.
    2. **Example 2:**
        - Statement: If you have connections with seniors, then you will get promoted.
        - p = You have connections with seniors, q = You get a promotion.
    
    **Truth Table:**
    
    - Evaluates the logical truth of the implication statement under different conditions of p and q.
    
    **Implication, Converse, Contrapositive, Inverse:**
    
    - **Implication (p→q):** If p, then q.
    - **Converse (q→p):** If q, then p.
    - **Contrapositive (˥q→˥p):** If not q, then not p.
    - **Inverse (˥p→˥q):** If not p, then not q.
    
    **Facts:**
    
    1. Implication is equivalent to the contrapositive.
    2. Converse and Inverse are equivalent to each other.
    3. Converse & Inverse are NOT equivalent to Implication.
